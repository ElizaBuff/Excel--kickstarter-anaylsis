# Performing Analysis on Kickstarter Date to Uncover Trends

## Overview of Project
### Purpose of Project
In this project, I demonstrated my proficiency with various features in excel including: conditional formatting, debugging errors, VLOOKUPs, and creating interactive charts and graphs with pivot charts. To accomplish these goals, I was given a fictional situation and data set of several thousand crowdfunding projects. 
### Background of Project
Louise, an up-and-coming playwright, wants to start a crowd funding campaign to fund her play *FEVER*.   
Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create.

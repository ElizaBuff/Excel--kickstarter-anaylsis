## Performing analysis on Kickstarter date to uncover trends

In this challenge, you will continue to exercise your Excel prowess! This time, you will create two new analyses: outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date.

Louise’s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that you’ve already combed through, you’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. You’ll then submit a written report based on your analysis and the visualizations you create.
